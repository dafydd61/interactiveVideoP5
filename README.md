## Hi there

Welcome to Interactive Video! We're going to spend the day digging into two of the most popular tools used by artists and designers to create reactive and interactive work: Arduino and Processing.

## Examples
- Aaron Koblin: [Radiohead, *House of Cards*](https://github.com/dataarts/radiohead) (Processing)
- Ole Kristensen, [*Body Navigation*](https://vimeo.com/1362832) (Processing, Infrared Camera)
- Klaus Obermaier and Ars Electronica Futurelab, [*Le Sacre du Printemps *](http://www.exile.at/sacre/) (?)
- Nils VÃ¶lker, [*One Hundred and Eight*](http://nilsvoelker.com/content/onehundredandeight/index.html) (Processing, Arduino (presumably))
- Golan Levin, Zachary Lieberman, Jaap Blonk, and Joan La Barbara, [*Messa di voce*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoqiyB1ndE) (Processing(?))

## What we're going to learn

### Processing
- Basics: drawing shapes, colours, moving stuff around, basic math
- Pictures: displaying them, manipulating them
- Pixels: looking at pictures as a list of numbers, and manipulating those numbers one-by-one
- Videos: playing, controlling playback

### Arduino
- How to get information from the physical world
- How to talk to the world physically i.e. not through a screen or keyboard

In the process, we'll build some basic reactive pieces. True *interaction* is beyond the scope of this workshop, but we're going to come out with the tools to start down that road.
