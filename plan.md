## Intro

1. Me, you
1. Examples
	- My Grandfather's House (Procesing, openFrameworks)
	- [Road Trip](https://vimeo.com/193215771) (Procesing, openFrameworks)
	- Aaron Koblin: [Radiohead, *House of Cards*](https://github.com/dataarts/radiohead) (Processing)
	- Cheryl Sourkes, [*Everybody's Autobiography*](http://cherylsourkes.com/everybodys-autobiography/) (Processing, JavaScript)
	- Gerda Cammaer, [*Maputo Praia*](https://vimeo.com/76016374) (Processing, Pure Data)
	- Nils VÃ¶lker, [*One Hundred and Eight*](http://nilsvoelker.com/content/onehundredandeight/index.html) (Processing, Arduino (presumably))
	- Ole Kristensen, [*Body Navigation*](https://vimeo.com/1362832) (Processing, Infrared Camera)
	- Klaus Obermaier and Ars Electronica Futurelab, [*Le Sacre du Printemps *](http://www.exile.at/sacre/) (?)

1. Intro to the tools
	- Arduino
	- Processing
1. What we're going to learn
	- **Procesing**
		1. Basics
			- the window
			- drawing shapes
			- foreground & background
			- colours
			- getting help
				- Documentation
				- Example sketches
			- moving stuff around
			- interacting using the mouse: mouseX, mouseY, pmouseX, pmouseY
			- doing some basic math
		1. Pictures
			- loading and displaying photos
			- playing with pictures: colour, alpha, filters
			- copying part or all of a picture (get(), copy())
			- moving pictures around with the mouse
		1. Pixels
			- looking at pictures as a list of numbers
			- manipulating pixels one-by-one
			- alpha masking
		2. Videos
			- Playing videos
			- Controlling video playback
			- reactive playback
	- **Arduino**
		- How to get information from the physical world
			- Photoresistor
			- Buttons
			- Knobs
			- other...
		- How to talk to the world physically i.e. not through a screen or keyboard
			- light
			- motion
	- **Putting it together**
		- Firmata
	- In the process, we'll build some basic reactive pieces. True *interaction* is beyond the scope of this workshop, but we're going to come out with the tools to start down that road.
